# Arduino-Based Robotic Arm Chess System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is an **automated chess-playing robotic arm system** built using **WLKATA Mirobot**, **Arduino**, and the **Stockfish chess engine**.  
The robotic arm physically moves pieces on a real chessboard based on AI-calculated moves.  
Through coordinate-based control and serial communication, the robot can both move and capture pieces automatically.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Stockfish Integration**: Uses AI to calculate the next best move
- **Coordinate-Based Control**: Translates chessboard positions into precise robotic movements
- **Piece Capturing & Placement**: Automatically removes opponent pieces and places the player's piece
- **Auto & Manual Modes**: Supports both AI-driven autonomous moves and user-controlled operations
- **Serial Communication**: Commands are sent from Python to Arduino, which controls the robotic arm
